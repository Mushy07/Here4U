# Track 1: Mental Health Support for Students
# Problem Statement: University students often feel overwhelmed by academic and personal pressures yet lack a safe space to express their struggles. Fear of judgment, broken trust, and dismissive responses from peers discourage them from sharing openly, leaving them isolated and unsupported. At the same time, many struggle to track and understand their own emotions, making it difficult to identify patterns, triggers, and effective coping strategies.

#Here4U
Here4U is a mental health support application designed specifically for university students. Many students face stress, anxiety, and emotional challenges but often feel uncertain about seeking professional help. Here4U bridges the gap between doing nothing and seeing a professional by providing a safe, anonymous, and supportive space.

The app empowers students to take the first steps in caring for their mental well-being through:
ü§ù Matchmaking for Conversations ‚Äì Get paired with other users to talk about your situation and find a listening ear.
üó£Ô∏è Community Forum ‚Äì Share your struggles, ask questions, and support others by giving advice in an open forum.
üìì Mood Diary ‚Äì Log your mood daily and gain insights into your emotional patterns and behavioral changes over time.
üïµÔ∏è Full Anonymity ‚Äì All users are completely anonymous, creating a safe environment to express feelings without fear of judgment.

With Here4U, students are reminded that they are never alone. Help, encouragement, and understanding are always within reach.

# Track 1: Mental Health Support for Students
# Problem Statement: University students face increasing mental health challenges, yet many avoid seeking help due to stigma or limited counseling resources, leaving them without accessible, proactive tools for self-care and stress¬†management.

#Here4U
Here4U is a mental health support application designed specifically for university students. Many students face stress, anxiety, and emotional challenges but often feel uncertain about seeking professional help. Here4U bridges the gap between doing nothing and seeing a professional by providing a safe, anonymous, and supportive space.

The app empowers students to take the first steps in caring for their mental well-being through:
ü§ù Matchmaking for Conversations ‚Äì Get paired with other users to talk about your situation and find a listening ear.
üó£Ô∏è Community Forum ‚Äì Share your struggles, ask questions, and support others by giving advice in an open forum.
üìì Mood Diary ‚Äì Log your mood daily and gain insights into your emotional patterns and behavioral changes over time.
üïµÔ∏è Full Anonymity ‚Äì All users are completely anonymous, creating a safe environment to express feelings without fear of judgment.

With Here4U, students are reminded that they are never alone. Help, encouragement, and understanding are always within reach.
